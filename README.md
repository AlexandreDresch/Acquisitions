| **TypeScript**                      | Provides full type safety throughout the application for reliability.                                                                      |
| **Neon Postgres** & **Drizzle ORM** | Fully managed, serverless PostgreSQL database paired with a lightweight, TypeScript-first ORM for type-safe queries and schema migrations. |
| **Arcjet**                          | A developer-first security layer for real-time **bot protection**, **rate limiting**, and defense against common attacks.                  |
| **Zod**                             | TypeScript schema validation library ensuring runtime type safety and data integrity for all API inputs.                                   |
| **Docker**                          | Containerization for consistent development, testing, and production environments.                                                         |

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlexandreDresch/Acquisitions.git
    cd acquisitions
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    ```bash

2.  **Offer Submission** ‚Üí Buyers submit offers on active listings.
3.  **Deal Negotiation** ‚Üí Parties communicate via built-in messaging.
4.  **Deal Acceptance** ‚Üí Seller accepts one offer (automatically rejects others).
5.  **Deal Completion** ‚Üí Seller marks the deal as completed.
6.  **Status Tracking** ‚Üí Real-time status updates throughout the process.

## üß™ Testing

The project uses **Jest** for testing, including unit, service, and integration tests for HTTP endpoints using **SuperTest**.

```bash
# Run all tests and generate a coverage report
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests for a specific file
npm test -- tests/unit/services/auth.service.test.ts
```

---

## üìä Code Quality

Code quality is enforced using ESLint and Prettier.

```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Database Connection** | Ensure PostgreSQL is running, check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, and run `npm run db:migrate`. |
| **JWT Errors** | Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set in environment variables and check token expiration settings. |
| **Arcjet Configuration** | Ensure `ARCJET_KEY` is set in `.env` and verify network connectivity to Arcjet services. |
| **Deal Authorization** | Check middleware to ensure users can only access their own deals/listings and verify role permissions for sensitive operations. |
